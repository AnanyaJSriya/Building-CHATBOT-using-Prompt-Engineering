🧠 Prompt Engineering Capacity: Ananya J Sriya
As an AI Engineer specializing in Contextual Intelligence and Prompt Orchestration, I specialize in transforming raw LLMs into mission-critical business tools. My approach combines linguistic precision with robust software engineering to build AI that is reliable, safe, and context-aware.

Core Competencies
System Prompt Architecture: Designing high-constraint personas (like the "Socratic Student") to prevent hallucinations and maintain conversational intent.

Latency-Optimized Inference: Implementing quantized models and asynchronous processing to achieve "near-zero lag" in voice and text interactions.

Privacy-First Design: Architecting HIPAA and GDPR-compliant AI systems that utilize local inference (Ollama/Llama-3) to ensure data sovereignty.

CI/CD for LLMs: Using GitHub Actions and Pytest to validate prompt behavior automatically, ensuring that model updates don't break persona consistency.
